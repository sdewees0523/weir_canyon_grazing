Data Description: Cleaned and joined data from the dry and wet weight raw data described in the "raw data" folder. In instances where multiple bags were used to measure dry weights, these values were summed to get one total value per clipping quadrat. The wet and dry weight data frames were joined by matching the block, treatment, and clip columns. All data manipulation was done in R version 4.2.2

Column Descriptions: 
	- block: The block that the clipping took place in. Each block consists of three units, one unit for each of the three treatments. This value is numerical and can have a value of 1, 2, or 3. 
	
	- treatment: The treatment type the clipping took place in. There are three possible treatments: low grazing, precision grazing, and control (e.g. no grazing). This value is a character string and can have a value of "low", 	"precision", or "control".
	
	- clip: The clip number for the block x treatment unit that row represents. Three clips per block x treatment unit were taken. This value is numeric and can have a value of 1, 2 or 3. 
	
	- bag: Some clips had more biomass than could fit in a single paper bag. In cases where this occurred, bag numbers were recorded and dry weight was weighed separately. This value is numeric and can have a value of 1 or 2. 
	
	- wet_weight_g: This is the wet weight of biomass only, calculated as raw_wet_weight_g - bag_weight_g * number of bags used. The units of this value are grams. This value is numeric. 
	
	- species: This is the species visually assessed to be most dominant in the quadrat biomass was collected from. This value is a character string. Each species is represented by 6 letters where the first three letters are the first 	three letters of the species' genus and the fourth through sixth letters are the first three letters of the species name. If multiple species are recorded, they are separated by a comma. 

	- secondary_species: These are any other species observed to be in the quadrat biomass was collected from. This value is a character string. Each species is represented by 6 letters where the first three letters are the first 	three letters of the species' genus and the fourth through sixth letters are the first three letters of the species name. If multiple species are recorded, they are separated by a comma. 

	- date: This is the date that samples were collected in the field, NOT the date dry mass was measured. The format of this value is mm/dd/yyyy. 

	- dry_mass_g: This is the dry mass of biomass only, calculated as raw_dry_weight_g - bag_weight_g. In instances, where multiple bags were used to measure dry mass, these values were summed. The units of this value are grams and 	go to two decimal places. This value is numeric.
	
	- lfm: This is the calculated fuel moisture of the biomass. This was calculated as (wet_weight_g - dry_mass_g)/(dry_mass_g) * 100. The value is a percent and is numeric.
